# Method for 1 cup Hario V60 brewer
This recipes makes around 250ml of coffee

1. Put filter paper into your V60, and place it on top of your mug or server. Rinse the paper with hot water, then discard the water.
Rinsing gets rid of the paper taste, and also pre-warms the brewer and mug or server.


2. Grind 15g of coffee and place it in the filter.
Gently tap the V60 on the bench to settle the grounds into a flat bed.

3. Gently pour in 50g of water, just off the boil.
Your water should be around 96°C. If you don’t have a temperature-controlled kettle, leave your water for a minute or two once it’s boiled and you’ll be close.
It helps to pour the water in a circular pattern from the outside of the filter towards the centre.

4. Stir to make sure all the grounds are wet, and wait 30 seconds.
This initial wait is called the bloom and gives time for the gasses trapped in the coffee to escape.

5. Gently pour in more water until you’ve added a total of 250ml . Pour using a circular motion.
Pour each new batch of water in gently, trying not to disturb the coffee grounds too much.

6. Gently stir again once the pour is complete.
Stirring will help ensure all the grounds are evenly extracted.

7. Swirl your server or mug, then enjoy!
Swirling helps mix and aerate the brew.
