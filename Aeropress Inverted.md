# Method for Inverted Aeropress
This recipe makes around 210ml of coffee - which should fit in a mug, but check how much fits in your mug.

You’re literally inverting the Aeropress, which sounds crazy but works: it's formed a seal at that point so no water drips through the filter until you push (there’s a gif on our website: https://static.samplecoffee.com.au/brewguides/aeropress/aero-invert-anim.gif)

You’ll get a slightly different flavour because this leaves more water during the immersion stage of the brew, before pressure forces the water through the coffee grounds and filter.

1. Put the paper filter into the base and rinse well.
Rinsing gets rid of the paper taste, and also pre-warms your cup (don’t forget to throw out the rinse water from your cup before brewing)

2. Put the Aeropress together on top of your cup.

3. Grind 14g of coffee and place in the Aeropress.
Freshly ground is always best, and for Aeropress it should be similar in size to rough beach sand.

4. Pour 220ml of hot water into the Aeropress.
If you don’t have scales, fill the Aeropress until it’s almost full ( just above the 4 marker).
The water is best at around 92° celsius. If you don’t have a temperature controlled kettle, leave the water for a minute or two after it’s boiled.

5. Stir well then put on the top of the Aeropress.
Once you put the top on, you’ll form a seal and stop any more water from draining through into your cup.

6. Wait two minutes and then press until you hear air hiss.
It takes a little bit of pressure to push the water through the paper. You’re aiming for this step to take around 30 seconds.

7. Enjoy!
