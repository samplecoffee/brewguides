# Method for Moccamaster batch brewer
This recipe makes the full 1.25 litre thermos of coffee. If you’re already twitchy and a full 1.25 litres is a little scary, just scale back the coffee and water in the usual 1:16 ratio of grounds to water.

You’ll want to grind slightly more finely than you would for manual pour-over techniques such as V60 or Chemex.

1. Fold the filter paper
Fold each join, so the paper sits nicely in the basket

2. Rinse the paper and basket with hot water
This removes the taste of the paper, and warms the basket and carafe

3. Grind 78g of coffee
Use a slightly more fine grind setting than you use for V60 or Chemex

4. Fill tank with 1.2 litres of room-temperature or cold water
The Mocca Master’s heating system works best with water at cooler temperatures.

5. Set the filter basket to closed
Move the switch on the side of the basket to the setting marked X.

6. Start the brewer
Turn on the switch and make sure the carafe is pressed against the brewing chamber.

7. Stir
Once the filter basket is half-full of water, use a spoon to mix the slurry and make sure the grounds are all evenly damp — be careful not to rip the filter paper.

8. Set the filter basket to open
Move the switch on the basket to the setting marked O, which will allow coffee to pour out into the carafe.

9. Gently lift and tap the filter basket
Towards the end of the brew, gently lift and re-seat the filter basket in its holder. This will help settle the bed of grounds to ensure an even extraction.

10. Share!
Give the carafe a gentle swirl to mix, then share your brew with your friends.
