# Method for 6 Cup Chemex
This recipe makes around 800ml of coffee

1. Put the filter paper into your Chemex with the thicker (3-ply) side toward the spout.
It’s best to put the thicker side of the filter across the spout so the paper won’t tear.

1. Rinse the paper with hot water, then discard the water.
Rinsing gets rid of the paper taste, and also pre-warms the Chemex brewer.

1. To discard the water, gently tip the Chemex to pour the water out the spout.
It’s a good idea to warm your cups with some hot water too.

1. Grind 44g of coffee and place it in the filter.
Gently tap the Chemex on the bench to settle the grounds into a flat bed.

1. Gently pour in 80g water, just off the boil.
It helps to pour the water in a circular pattern from the outside of the filter towards the centre.

1. Stir to make sure all the grounds are wet, and wait 30 seconds.
This initial wait is called the bloom and gives time for the gasses trapped in the coffee to escape.

1. Pour the remaining water in three batches of 240g using a circular motion, until you’ve poured a total of 800g, including the bloom.
Pour each batch of water in slowly, trying not to disturb the coffee grounds too much.

1. Once brew is complete, lift out the filter paper, swirl the Chemex to mix the coffee, and enjoy!
A gentle swirl helps mix and aerate the brew.
